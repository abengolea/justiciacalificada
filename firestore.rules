/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset establishes a security model for a lawyer-driven courthouse rating application.
 * It provides a mix of private user-owned data, publicly readable content, and admin-managed entities.
 * The primary goals are to ensure lawyers can only manage their own profiles and ratings, protect the integrity
 * of courthouse data, and restrict sensitive operations to administrators.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /lawyers/{uid}: Private user profiles, where the document ID matches the user's Auth UID.
 * - /courthouses/{courthouseId}: Publicly available information about courthouses.
 * - /courthouses/{courthouseId}/ratings/{ratingId}: User-submitted ratings, which are publicly readable.
 * - /courthouses/{courthouseId}/statistics/{statisticId}: Publicly readable, aggregated statistics, not writable by clients.
 * - /roles_admin/{uid}: A collection where the existence of a document grants a user admin privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Ownership: A lawyer's profile in `/lawyers` is strictly private and can only be accessed or modified by the owner. Listing lawyers is disabled to prevent user enumeration.
 * - Public Read, Admin Write: Core data like `/courthouses` is readable by anyone but can only be modified by users designated as admins via the `/roles_admin` collection.
 * - Denormalized Ownership for Subcollections: Each `rating` document contains a `lawyerId` field. This denormalization is critical for security, allowing write-access checks directly on the document without needing expensive or impossible lookups to other collections.
 * - Read-Only Data: Aggregated data like `/statistics` is completely locked down from client writes to ensure data integrity. These documents are expected to be updated by trusted server-side processes.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To create simpler, more performant rules, we denormalize the `lawyerId` onto each `rating` document. This allows a fast, simple rule like `isOwner(resource.data.lawyerId)` without any extra `get()` calls to check who created the rating.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The data is naturally segregated into top-level collections based on access patterns (e.g., private `lawyers` vs. public `courthouses`), which is a secure and performant design.
